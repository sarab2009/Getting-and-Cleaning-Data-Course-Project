# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The data represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
This repository includes the run_analysis.R script that downloads the data from [this link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and makes a tidy data set from it.

## Requirements
run_analysis.R needs [reshape2](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/index.html) package which has to be installed before the run.
